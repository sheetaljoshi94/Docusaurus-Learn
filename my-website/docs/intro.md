## Yoga basics

The building blocks of a yoga class are a series of specific movements, called poses, coupled with specific breathing techniques and concepts of meditation. There are combinations and changes that can be made to assist students if a pose causes discomfort or proves too hard. Props such as bricks, blankets and straps can be used to help you get the most advantage from the poses, including chairs. Yoga is not one-size-fits-all: Depending on your individual needs and objectives, the best yoga workout for you will depend.
